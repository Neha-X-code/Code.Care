But public statements like that don\\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Newsom already reached out to lawmakers earlier this month to ensure they\\u2019ve got his back. While democratic lawmakers tend to support democratic incumbent governors, it\\u2019s worth noting that newsom has had an uneven relationship with frustrated legislators, who often feel blindsided and cut out of pandemic management  friedman among them. This came after california democratic party chair rusty hicks and a bevy of elected democrats held a press conference pinning the recall on far-right extremists. Hicks has since walked back his rhetoric equating the recall push with a \\u201ccoup,\\u201d but the fact that the conference happened in the first place signals that people in newsom\\u2019s political orbit are taking the effort seriously. Whether or not recall proponents collect the 1. 5 million valid signatures they need by mid-march, the consensus out there is that newsom cannot afford to ignore the effort. His allies have brushed back emerging contenders, as when state sen. Scott wiener warned certain tech titans they were flirting with \\u201ca maga revenge fantasy. \\u201d in other words, now is when newsom needs his friends. That means the interest groups and wealthy donors that support his agenda as well as elected democrats  and you can bet some of the latter are quietly assessing what newsom\\u2019s ouster would mean for their own political prospects. Meanwhile, one of the potentially decisive determinants of newsom\\u2019s fate  the push to get schools reopened  is fueling some tension with teachers unions, another democratic mainstay, as our mackenzie mays scooped. Buenos d\\u00edas, good friday morning. Newsom is expected to swear in assemblymember shirley weber today as california's next secretary of state after weber got final approval on thursday from the legislature.

This time around, it\\u2019s the liberals\\u2019 assisted-dying legislation, bill c-7, which would extend medical assistance in dying to those whose deaths aren\\u2019t reasonably foreseeable. The liberals want to get it passed in time to meet a dec. 18 court deadline, but the conservatives are  opposed and have been talking out the clock for days. There\\u2019s no end to the standoff in sight, with the house of commons slated to rise on friday until jan. 25. The liberals have already received two extensions from the quebec court that ruled the existing assisted-dying law unconstitutional. A government official tells corridors they could ask for a third extension, but there\\u2019s no guarantee they\\u2019d get it. Meanwhile, the conservatives say the liberals brought this on themselves by proroguing parliament in august and then dilly-dallying before they reintroduced the bill in october. \\u201cthe government is 100 percent responsible for the fact that we are now so close to the date identified by the court,\\u201d conservative house leader g\\u00e9rard deltell tells corridors. Deltell, one of a handful of conservative mps to support bill c-7, says it won\\u2019t be the end of the world if it doesn\\u2019t pass by dec. 18. But justice minister david lametti told reporters tuesday that if that happens, it will create a \\u201clegal vacuum\\u201d in quebec, where the existing law will no longer apply.  of note: liberal mp and physician marcus powlowski has spoken to cbc news about why he was the lone liberal to vote against the assisted-dying bill.  looking back: it\\u2019s worth noting that the only pieces of legislation to gain royal assent since september have been covid-related. This new session has been bookended by big promises from the liberals, first in september\\u2019s throne speech and again in last week\\u2019s fiscal update. But with the country still mired in the pandemic\\u2019s second wave, many of those promises  on childcare and a green recovery, for example  have been punted to some future date.  old promises, new legislation: in recent weeks, the liberals have introduced a number of new bills to fulfill 2019 campaign pledges, including net-zero legislation, an overhaul of privacy laws and a bill to align federal law with the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. But those bills haven\\u2019t made it past the first steps of the legislative process, and with a spring election looking like a distinct possibility, it remains to be seen how many of them actually pass.  and more: the liberals will also introduce a bill to implement canada\\u2019s new trade deal with the u. K. this week. They may also introduce legislation to allow elections canada to run a federal election during the pandemic.  otherwise: this sitting has been most notable for proving that mps can still heckle, filibuster and make embarrassing blunders even when they\\u2019re not all in the same room. Deltell said all parties \\u201cput a lot of water in their wine\\u201d and worked together to make the first-ever hybrid parliament work. As for the partisanship that has ensued ever since: \\u201cthis is what democracy\\u2019s all about. \\u201d in honor of the close of this first hybrid sitting, corridors asked mps to reflect on the most surprising or unusual thing to have happened in parliament since september. Nathaniel erskine-smith, liberal mp: the most unusual thing for me personally has been the balance between parliamentary and parenting duties in a pandemic. I was able to vote virtually for the first time while reading shel silverstein poems to our four-year-old mack during his bedtime routine. Last night, when our 11-month-old crawford woke up at 10 p. m. , i was able to rock him back to sleep while we passed the main estimates. I hope we seriously consider making virtual voting a more permanent part of our work going forward. A more general surprise has been how quickly all parties went from \\u201cwe\\u2019re all in this together\\u201d to resorting to standard partisan talking points and jabs. Marilyn gladu, conservative mp: hot mic moments, like [liberal minister] maryam monsef asking her staff what her salary was. [\\u201chow much do i make now? like 250?\\u201d] [liberal mp] hedy fry forgetting to mute herself during votes, nathaniel erskine-smith's children crying and the myriad of barking dogs while voting. Charlie angus, ndp mp: what i found completely strange\\u2026 was the relentless filibustering at [the ethics committee] by the liberals. I can\\u2019t figure out what was the political calculus that made them think that was a good idea. I\\u2019ve never seen a government shut down a committee like that. I like the people on the committee. These are not hard asses they sent in. But when you\\u2019re wasting people\\u2019s time to that extent, you do burn bridges. It\\u2019s a lot harder to have trust. Corridors is a new weekly newsletter for mps, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\\u2019s going on around parliament hill. Every wednesday we will look at the people pulling the levers of power in ottawa and the questions that are influencing decisions on parliament hill and in the provinces. Join the conversation! you can email us at mforrest  com, ablatchford  com, lgardner  com and sallan  com. Two long years  thursday marks the two-year anniversary since michael kovrig and michael spavor were detained in china in apparent retaliation for the arrest of huawei executive meng wanzhou in vancouver on a u. S. extradition request. In an interview with politico\\u2019s andy blatchford, kovrig\\u2019s wife, vina nadjibulla, says she\\u2019s hopeful the incoming biden administration \\u201ccould spell out good news for michael\\u2019s freedom. \\\" knowing that he\\u2019s not been forgotten in canada \\u201cgives him a sense of not being alone and keeps hope alive for him,\\u201d she said.  glimmer of hope: the two-year milestone comes just as the wall street journal reported last week that meng has been negotiating a deal with the u. S. Department of justice that would allow her to return to china. The news has raised hopes that a deal could also lead to freedom for the two michaels, though prime minister justin trudeau has refused to comment.  on tuesday: dominic barton, canada\\u2019s ambassador to china, told a parliamentary committee that kovrig and spavor are physically and mentally healthy. \\\"they're very, very strong  it's remarkable,\\\" he said. More money, fewer strings  the prime minister is slated to meet with provincial premiers on thursday, but the purpose of the meeting depends on who you ask. The premiers, who\\u2019ve been demanding this meeting for months, want ottawa to agree to pay billions more in health transfers to the provinces. They say the federal share of health-care funding has dropped to about 22 percent, and they want that hiked to 35 percent  a difference of c$28 billion this year alone. Oddly, health transfers didn\\u2019t come up when intergovernmental affairs minister dominic leblanc spoke tuesday about the meeting, which he said the government is \\u201cvery much looking forward to. \\u201d on his agenda? definitely the pandemic and vaccines. Oh, and the liberals\\u2019 new line about how ottawa is responsible for eight out of every 10 dollars spent by all governments fighting the pandemic. That might come up, \\u00e0 propos of nothing.  ask and you shan\\u2019t receive: the provinces demanding increased health transfers and ottawa looking in the other direction is nothing new. Recall 2016, when the provinces demanded more money and the liberals instead offered targeted funding for home care and mental health. This time around, ottawa would do better to spend big on a national pharmacare system, rather than \\u201cplowing money through a largely unconditional canada health transfer,\\u201d said gregory marchildon, professor of health policy at the university of toronto. Similarly, livio di matteo, professor of economics at lakehead university, said the liberals are likely only interested in upping health-care funding \\u201cif they can get the provinces onside on targeted initiatives that the federal government favors. \\u201d the liberals have promised national standards for long-term care, but they haven\\u2019t yet attached any money to the commitment, and several premiers have said ottawa should stay out of provincial jurisdiction. In any case, it\\u2019s not clear ottawa is prepared for any long-term discussions on thursday. \\u201ccanadians want us to remain focused on seeing them through this pandemic,\\u201d leblanc said. Show time  it seems impossible the premiers could meet without talking about vaccines, given the rubber is on the verge of hitting the road in canada. To recap: the u. K. started inoculating its citizens with the pfizer vaccine on tuesday. On monday, trudeau announced canada will receive 249,000 doses of the pfizer vaccine before the end of the year, and vaccines will start to roll out next week pending regulatory approval. The canadian military is undertaking a \\u201cdry run\\u201d of the distribution process, and provinces are announcing which priority groups will get the first vaccines. Meanwhile, alberta announced strict new lockdown measures tuesday in response to surging case numbers.  no fear: on tuesday, leblanc dismissed concerns that an executive order signed by u. S. President donald trump to prioritize americans for covid-19 vaccines could affect canada\\u2019s supply. He pointed out that pfizer has manufacturing facilities in europe as well as the u. S. , and reports say canada\\u2019s initial doses will come from belgium.  vaccine politics: the opposition parties have expended considerable energy in recent weeks slamming the liberals for not having a clear plan to receive or distribute vaccines. If the rollout trudeau promised takes place as planned, it seems that could take some of the wind out of their sails. But deltell suggested to corridors that trudeau\\u2019s announcement monday was a result of the intense pressure applied by the tories. Hey, if you can\\u2019t knock it, might as well take credit for it. Move over, keystone xl  the future of the canada-u. S. energy relationship may not be about oil, but about minerals. As the incoming biden administration and like-minded leaders try to wean the world off fossil fuels, they\\u2019re relying on a non-renewable resource: the rare earths and minerals needed for the production of rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. The hitch: these materials are overwhelmingly produced by china. As tensions rise with beijing, washington is looking around for alternative supplies \\u2013 and canada wants in. In a new episode of politico\\u2019s global translations podcast, hosts luiza savage and ryan heath talk to canada\\u2019s ambassador kirsten hillman about how canada plans to boost domestic mining and collaborate with the u.

The assessment follows on the heels of a report from the canada energy regulator, which found that more stringent climate policies might mean canada won\\u2019t need all the new pipeline capacity expected from three major projects  the trans mountain expansion, keystone xl and line 3.

Savage and andy blatchford\",\n          \"And iii: if you know one thing about the arcane subject of budget reconciliation, it\\u2019s that it can be used to pass legislation through the senate with just 51 votes rather than the 60 it takes to overcome a filibuster. If you know two things, it\\u2019s the simple majority rule and that reconciliation can be used only once every fiscal year. Congress didn\\u2019t pass a budget resolution last year, so democrats used reconciliation left over from fiscal year 2021 to pass president joe biden\\u2019s $1. 9 trillion american rescue plan. That means they still have the fiscal 2022 reconciliation bill left as a vehicle for portions of biden\\u2019s infrastructure, tax, climate and social welfare agenda. But what if, buried in the rules of the congressional budget act of 1974, there were a magical parliamentary trick that democrats could use to unlock a third reconciliation bill this year? senate majority leader chuck schumer believes he has found it. It\\u2019s called section 304, and you\\u2019re about to start hearing about it a lot. This section of the law that governs the congressional budgeting process essentially says that congress may revisit and amend an already-passed budget resolution, like the one used to pass the covid relief package. Or at least that\\u2019s what schumer aides are arguing. \\u201crecently, top policy aides to majority leader schumer made the argument to the senate parliamentarian that section 304 allows for at least one additional set of reconciliation bills related to revenue, spending and the public debt to be considered for fiscal year 2021,\\u201d a schumer aide previewing the strategy told us sunday night. While democrats haven\\u2019t made a final decision on the legislative strategy, there is deep skepticism in both the white house and among senate democrats that any 60-vote bill on any significant issue is possible this year. It was already conventional wisdom that biden is likely to be able to pass two reconciliation bills and almost nothing else. Now, schumer may try to squeeze a third one out of the system. His office tells us that section 304 has never been used before. If he goes forward with the plan, the senate parliamentarian will once again be the most powerful person in washington, just as she was over the debate about whether the minimum wage was eligible for inclusion in the last reconciliation bill. It goes without saying that this is a bizarre way to govern. Nobody would design a system like this, where to pass even popular legislation senators seek to game a rickety budgeting process and the most important hill staffers are now the experts on these arcane rules devised in 1974 for the purpose of deficit reduction. But as long as the filibuster remains, senators will continue to try to push the boundaries of what can be accomplished through reconciliation. Judge for yourself. Here\\u2019s the fine print of section 304: \\u201cat any time after the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year has been agreed to pursuant to section 301, and before the end of such fiscal year, the two houses may adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget which revises or reaffirms the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year most recently agreed to. \\u201d good monday morning.

First in playbook  in a letter to speaker nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy this morning, the 58-member house problem solvers caucus calls for changes to allow for more input from rank-and-file members in the legislative process. Specifically, they ask the leaders to move to \\u201cregular order\\u201d  working through the committee process, as opposed to taking bills straight to the floor  and to allow more amendments to legislation.

She will be focused on the diplomatic side, working with guatemala, el salvador and honduras to try to stop the flow of migrants from those countries, and not on the difficult task of deciding who is let into the u. S. , where they are housed and what to do with the children who arrive without their parents. \\u2026 still, harris\\u2019 project is central to biden\\u2019s argument that he\\u2019ll succeed in restoring american influence and credibility abroad and making the immigration process more humane. \\u201d the president\\u2019s pitchman  \\u201cbuttigieg has a bridge to sell you,\\u201d by christopher cadelago, sam mintz and tanya snyder: \\u201cbuttigieg may be the youngest of president joe biden\\u2019s cabinet secretaries and the one with the most on-the-job learning to do.

But public statements like that don\\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Newsom already reached out to lawmakers earlier this month to ensure they\\u2019ve got his back. While democratic lawmakers tend to support democratic incumbent governors, it\\u2019s worth noting that newsom has had an uneven relationship with frustrated legislators, who often feel blindsided and cut out of pandemic management  friedman among them. This came after california democratic party chair rusty hicks and a bevy of elected democrats held a press conference pinning the recall on far-right extremists. Hicks has since walked back his rhetoric equating the recall push with a \\u201ccoup,\\u201d but the fact that the conference happened in the first place signals that people in newsom\\u2019s political orbit are taking the effort seriously. Whether or not recall proponents collect the 1. 5 million valid signatures they need by mid-march, the consensus out there is that newsom cannot afford to ignore the effort. His allies have brushed back emerging contenders, as when state sen. Scott wiener warned certain tech titans they were flirting with \\u201ca maga revenge fantasy. \\u201d in other words, now is when newsom needs his friends. That means the interest groups and wealthy donors that support his agenda as well as elected democrats  and you can bet some of the latter are quietly assessing what newsom\\u2019s ouster would mean for their own political prospects. Meanwhile, one of the potentially decisive determinants of newsom\\u2019s fate  the push to get schools reopened  is fueling some tension with teachers unions, another democratic mainstay, as our mackenzie mays scooped. Buenos d\\u00edas, good friday morning. Newsom is expected to swear in assemblymember shirley weber today as california's next secretary of state after weber got final approval on thursday from the legislature. That means california will get its first black elections chief  and another special election to fill weber\\u2019s vacant, safely democratic san diego assembly seat. Quote of the day: \\u201cif everybody has to be vaccinated, we might as well just tell people the truth: there will be no in-person instruction in the state of california. \\u201d newsom offers some real talk on schools. Bonus qotd: \\u201chouse republicans and the trump administration achieved historic results for all americans. \\u2026 today, president trump committed to helping elect republicans in the house and senate in 2022. \\u201d house minority leader kevin mccarthy renews his vows to former president donald trump, who mccarthy visited in florida.

This time around, it\\u2019s the liberals\\u2019 assisted-dying legislation, bill c-7, which would extend medical assistance in dying to those whose deaths aren\\u2019t reasonably foreseeable. The liberals want to get it passed in time to meet a dec. 18 court deadline, but the conservatives are  opposed and have been talking out the clock for days. There\\u2019s no end to the standoff in sight, with the house of commons slated to rise on friday until jan. 25. The liberals have already received two extensions from the quebec court that ruled the existing assisted-dying law unconstitutional. A government official tells corridors they could ask for a third extension, but there\\u2019s no guarantee they\\u2019d get it. Meanwhile, the conservatives say the liberals brought this on themselves by proroguing parliament in august and then dilly-dallying before they reintroduced the bill in october. \\u201cthe government is 100 percent responsible for the fact that we are now so close to the date identified by the court,\\u201d conservative house leader g\\u00e9rard deltell tells corridors. Deltell, one of a handful of conservative mps to support bill c-7, says it won\\u2019t be the end of the world if it doesn\\u2019t pass by dec. 18. But justice minister david lametti told reporters tuesday that if that happens, it will create a \\u201clegal vacuum\\u201d in quebec, where the existing law will no longer apply.  of note: liberal mp and physician marcus powlowski has spoken to cbc news about why he was the lone liberal to vote against the assisted-dying bill.  looking back: it\\u2019s worth noting that the only pieces of legislation to gain royal assent since september have been covid-related. This new session has been bookended by big promises from the liberals, first in september\\u2019s throne speech and again in last week\\u2019s fiscal update. But with the country still mired in the pandemic\\u2019s second wave, many of those promises  on childcare and a green recovery, for example  have been punted to some future date.  old promises, new legislation: in recent weeks, the liberals have introduced a number of new bills to fulfill 2019 campaign pledges, including net-zero legislation, an overhaul of privacy laws and a bill to align federal law with the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. But those bills haven\\u2019t made it past the first steps of the legislative process, and with a spring election looking like a distinct possibility, it remains to be seen how many of them actually pass.  and more: the liberals will also introduce a bill to implement canada\\u2019s new trade deal with the u. K. this week. They may also introduce legislation to allow elections canada to run a federal election during the pandemic.  otherwise: this sitting has been most notable for proving that mps can still heckle, filibuster and make embarrassing blunders even when they\\u2019re not all in the same room. Deltell said all parties \\u201cput a lot of water in their wine\\u201d and worked together to make the first-ever hybrid parliament work. As for the partisanship that has ensued ever since: \\u201cthis is what democracy\\u2019s all about. \\u201d in honor of the close of this first hybrid sitting, corridors asked mps to reflect on the most surprising or unusual thing to have happened in parliament since september. Nathaniel erskine-smith, liberal mp: the most unusual thing for me personally has been the balance between parliamentary and parenting duties in a pandemic. I was able to vote virtually for the first time while reading shel silverstein poems to our four-year-old mack during his bedtime routine. Last night, when our 11-month-old crawford woke up at 10 p. m. , i was able to rock him back to sleep while we passed the main estimates. I hope we seriously consider making virtual voting a more permanent part of our work going forward. A more general surprise has been how quickly all parties went from \\u201cwe\\u2019re all in this together\\u201d to resorting to standard partisan talking points and jabs. Marilyn gladu, conservative mp: hot mic moments, like [liberal minister] maryam monsef asking her staff what her salary was. [\\u201chow much do i make now? like 250?\\u201d] [liberal mp] hedy fry forgetting to mute herself during votes, nathaniel erskine-smith's children crying and the myriad of barking dogs while voting. Charlie angus, ndp mp: what i found completely strange\\u2026 was the relentless filibustering at [the ethics committee] by the liberals. I can\\u2019t figure out what was the political calculus that made them think that was a good idea. I\\u2019ve never seen a government shut down a committee like that. I like the people on the committee. These are not hard asses they sent in. But when you\\u2019re wasting people\\u2019s time to that extent, you do burn bridges. It\\u2019s a lot harder to have trust. Corridors is a new weekly newsletter for mps, lobbyists, executives, activists and any readers who are interested in what\\u2019s going on around parliament hill. Every wednesday we will look at the people pulling the levers of power in ottawa and the questions that are influencing decisions on parliament hill and in the provinces. Join the conversation! you can email us at mforrest  com, ablatchford  com, lgardner  com and sallan  com. Two long years  thursday marks the two-year anniversary since michael kovrig and michael spavor were detained in china in apparent retaliation for the arrest of huawei executive meng wanzhou in vancouver on a u. S. extradition request. In an interview with politico\\u2019s andy blatchford, kovrig\\u2019s wife, vina nadjibulla, says she\\u2019s hopeful the incoming biden administration \\u201ccould spell out good news for michael\\u2019s freedom. \\\" knowing that he\\u2019s not been forgotten in canada \\u201cgives him a sense of not being alone and keeps hope alive for him,\\u201d she said.  glimmer of hope: the two-year milestone comes just as the wall street journal reported last week that meng has been negotiating a deal with the u. S. Department of justice that would allow her to return to china. The news has raised hopes that a deal could also lead to freedom for the two michaels, though prime minister justin trudeau has refused to comment.  on tuesday: dominic barton, canada\\u2019s ambassador to china, told a parliamentary committee that kovrig and spavor are physically and mentally healthy. \\\"they're very, very strong  it's remarkable,\\\" he said. More money, fewer strings  the prime minister is slated to meet with provincial premiers on thursday, but the purpose of the meeting depends on who you ask. The premiers, who\\u2019ve been demanding this meeting for months, want ottawa to agree to pay billions more in health transfers to the provinces. They say the federal share of health-care funding has dropped to about 22 percent, and they want that hiked to 35 percent  a difference of c$28 billion this year alone. Oddly, health transfers didn\\u2019t come up when intergovernmental affairs minister dominic leblanc spoke tuesday about the meeting, which he said the government is \\u201cvery much looking forward to. \\u201d on his agenda? definitely the pandemic and vaccines. Oh, and the liberals\\u2019 new line about how ottawa is responsible for eight out of every 10 dollars spent by all governments fighting the pandemic. That might come up, \\u00e0 propos of nothing.  ask and you shan\\u2019t receive: the provinces demanding increased health transfers and ottawa looking in the other direction is nothing new. Recall 2016, when the provinces demanded more money and the liberals instead offered targeted funding for home care and mental health. This time around, ottawa would do better to spend big on a national pharmacare system, rather than \\u201cplowing money through a largely unconditional canada health transfer,\\u201d said gregory marchildon, professor of health policy at the university of toronto. Similarly, livio di matteo, professor of economics at lakehead university, said the liberals are likely only interested in upping health-care funding \\u201cif they can get the provinces onside on targeted initiatives that the federal government favors. \\u201d the liberals have promised national standards for long-term care, but they haven\\u2019t yet attached any money to the commitment, and several premiers have said ottawa should stay out of provincial jurisdiction. In any case, it\\u2019s not clear ottawa is prepared for any long-term discussions on thursday. \\u201ccanadians want us to remain focused on seeing them through this pandemic,\\u201d leblanc said. Show time  it seems impossible the premiers could meet without talking about vaccines, given the rubber is on the verge of hitting the road in canada. To recap: the u. K. started inoculating its citizens with the pfizer vaccine on tuesday. On monday, trudeau announced canada will receive 249,000 doses of the pfizer vaccine before the end of the year, and vaccines will start to roll out next week pending regulatory approval. The canadian military is undertaking a \\u201cdry run\\u201d of the distribution process, and provinces are announcing which priority groups will get the first vaccines. Meanwhile, alberta announced strict new lockdown measures tuesday in response to surging case numbers.  no fear: on tuesday, leblanc dismissed concerns that an executive order signed by u. S. President donald trump to prioritize americans for covid-19 vaccines could affect canada\\u2019s supply. He pointed out that pfizer has manufacturing facilities in europe as well as the u. S. , and reports say canada\\u2019s initial doses will come from belgium.  vaccine politics: the opposition parties have expended considerable energy in recent weeks slamming the liberals for not having a clear plan to receive or distribute vaccines. If the rollout trudeau promised takes place as planned, it seems that could take some of the wind out of their sails. But deltell suggested to corridors that trudeau\\u2019s announcement monday was a result of the intense pressure applied by the tories. Hey, if you can\\u2019t knock it, might as well take credit for it. Move over, keystone xl  the future of the canada-u. S. energy relationship may not be about oil, but about minerals. As the incoming biden administration and like-minded leaders try to wean the world off fossil fuels, they\\u2019re relying on a non-renewable resource: the rare earths and minerals needed for the production of rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and solar panels. The hitch: these materials are overwhelmingly produced by china. As tensions rise with beijing, washington is looking around for alternative supplies \\u2013 and canada wants in. In a new episode of politico\\u2019s global translations podcast, hosts luiza savage and ryan heath talk to canada\\u2019s ambassador kirsten hillman about how canada plans to boost domestic mining and collaborate with the u. S. to diversify supply chains of so-called \\u201ccritical minerals\\u201d with partners \\u201cthat we can rely on when the going gets tough. \\u201d speaking of fossil fuels  the trans mountain pipeline remains a profitable investment for the federal government, according to a new report from canada\\u2019s budget watchdog, but that could change depending on global oil demand and ottawa\\u2019s climate-change policies. The assessment follows on the heels of a report from the canada energy regulator, which found that more stringent climate policies might mean canada won\\u2019t need all the new pipeline capacity expected from three major projects  the trans mountain expansion, keystone xl and line 3. Accountability season  it\\u2019s easy to miss amid the crush of headlines on the government\\u2019s vaccine plans, but there\\u2019s been some excellent reporting on the liberals\\u2019 pandemic relief programs and some possible  ahem  oversights. The financial post has this investigation regarding 68 canadian companies that have paid out billions in dividends to shareholders while receiving the federal wage subsidy. The cbc\\u2019s big spend series about where federal government money has really gone is worth some time. And there was this gem from ctv news about the cra deciding that right before christmas was a good time to ask some cerb recipients to pay back the entire c$14,000 they\\u2019ve received because of a misunderstanding about what \\u201cincome\\u201d means.

Savage and andy blatchford\",\n          \"And iii: if you know one thing about the arcane subject of budget reconciliation, it\\u2019s that it can be used to pass legislation through the senate with just 51 votes rather than the 60 it takes to overcome a filibuster. If you know two things, it\\u2019s the simple majority rule and that reconciliation can be used only once every fiscal year. Congress didn\\u2019t pass a budget resolution last year, so democrats used reconciliation left over from fiscal year 2021 to pass president joe biden\\u2019s $1. 9 trillion american rescue plan. That means they still have the fiscal 2022 reconciliation bill left as a vehicle for portions of biden\\u2019s infrastructure, tax, climate and social welfare agenda. But what if, buried in the rules of the congressional budget act of 1974, there were a magical parliamentary trick that democrats could use to unlock a third reconciliation bill this year? senate majority leader chuck schumer believes he has found it. It\\u2019s called section 304, and you\\u2019re about to start hearing about it a lot. This section of the law that governs the congressional budgeting process essentially says that congress may revisit and amend an already-passed budget resolution, like the one used to pass the covid relief package. Or at least that\\u2019s what schumer aides are arguing. \\u201crecently, top policy aides to majority leader schumer made the argument to the senate parliamentarian that section 304 allows for at least one additional set of reconciliation bills related to revenue, spending and the public debt to be considered for fiscal year 2021,\\u201d a schumer aide previewing the strategy told us sunday night. While democrats haven\\u2019t made a final decision on the legislative strategy, there is deep skepticism in both the white house and among senate democrats that any 60-vote bill on any significant issue is possible this year. It was already conventional wisdom that biden is likely to be able to pass two reconciliation bills and almost nothing else. Now, schumer may try to squeeze a third one out of the system. His office tells us that section 304 has never been used before. If he goes forward with the plan, the senate parliamentarian will once again be the most powerful person in washington, just as she was over the debate about whether the minimum wage was eligible for inclusion in the last reconciliation bill. It goes without saying that this is a bizarre way to govern. Nobody would design a system like this, where to pass even popular legislation senators seek to game a rickety budgeting process and the most important hill staffers are now the experts on these arcane rules devised in 1974 for the purpose of deficit reduction. But as long as the filibuster remains, senators will continue to try to push the boundaries of what can be accomplished through reconciliation. Judge for yourself. Here\\u2019s the fine print of section 304: \\u201cat any time after the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year has been agreed to pursuant to section 301, and before the end of such fiscal year, the two houses may adopt a concurrent resolution on the budget which revises or reaffirms the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year most recently agreed to. \\u201d good monday morning. What should lizza ask klain on thursday morning? got a news tip? a document to share? drop us a line: rachael bade, eugene daniels, ryan lizza, tara palmeri. First in playbook  in a letter to speaker nancy pelosi and house minority leader kevin mccarthy this morning, the 58-member house problem solvers caucus calls for changes to allow for more input from rank-and-file members in the legislative process. Specifically, they ask the leaders to move to \\u201cregular order\\u201d  working through the committee process, as opposed to taking bills straight to the floor  and to allow more amendments to legislation. The members also urge more \\u201cbipartisan support and solutions\\u201d to get legislation signed by the president. The news release with letter biden\\u2019s monday  the president and vp kamala harris will receive the president\\u2019s daily brief at 9:50 a. m. and a covid-19 briefing at 1:30 p. m. Biden will deliver remarks on the pandemic response and vaccinations at 2:10 p. m. in the south court auditorium, with harris attending.  the white house covid-19 response team and public health officials will brief at 11 a. m. Press secretary jen psaki will brief at 12:30 p. m. The house will meet in a pro forma session at 10:30 a. m. The senate will meet in a pro forma session at 11 a. m. The white house from 30,000 feet  \\u201cpath from clinton to biden takes u-turn on debt, trade, more,\\u201d ap: \\u201cpresident joe biden is dealing with harsh 21st century realities and his approach has been the exact opposite: borrow to spur growth, offer government aid without mandating work and bring global supply chains back to the united states. \\u201cthis change in democratic policy reflects the unique crises caused by the pandemic, as well as decades-old trends such as the rise of economic inequality, the downward slope of interest rates that made borrowing easier and globalization\\u2019s pitfalls as factories departed the midwest. White house aides are comparing the scope of biden\\u2019s policy ambitions to franklin delano roosevelt\\u2019s after the great depression. \\u201d the perils of being vp  \\u201cvice presidents\\u2019 policy projects come with political risks,\\u201d ap: \\u201cfor decades, the job of a vice president was to try to stay relevant, to avoid being viewed, in the words of one occupant of the post, as \\u2018standby equipment. \\u2019 but in recent administrations, the seconds-in-command have increasingly been deputized with special policy assignments that add some weight  and political risk  to the job. \\u201charris\\u2019 team has clarified that the vice president does not own all of immigration policy. She will be focused on the diplomatic side, working with guatemala, el salvador and honduras to try to stop the flow of migrants from those countries, and not on the difficult task of deciding who is let into the u. S. , where they are housed and what to do with the children who arrive without their parents. \\u2026 still, harris\\u2019 project is central to biden\\u2019s argument that he\\u2019ll succeed in restoring american influence and credibility abroad and making the immigration process more humane. \\u201d the president\\u2019s pitchman  \\u201cbuttigieg has a bridge to sell you,\\u201d by christopher cadelago, sam mintz and tanya snyder: \\u201cbuttigieg may be the youngest of president joe biden\\u2019s cabinet secretaries and the one with the most on-the-job learning to do. But he also comes with the most prominent reputation  a small-town mayor with big ideas and even bigger ambitions; the type of person who plunges so deep into new subjects that he might spend a casual evening sifting through a digital library on transportation and actually enjoy it. \\u201cwith the white house\\u2019s massive infrastructure bill set for its formal unveiling, he and his boss are looking to turn that reputation into a political asset. They want to make him one of the package\\u2019s chief pitchmen. \\u201d congress the democrats\\u2019 worker bees  \\u201chow 2 legislative tacticians scored big wins on child poverty in the stimulus,\\u201d nyt: \\u201c[rep.

Times: \\u201cfeinstein [who\\u2019s 87] has been in office for 10,372 days, breaking the record set by hiram johnson, a former governor who took office in the senate in march 1917 and served until his death in august 1945. \\u201d john lewis\\u2019 successor  \\u201cnikema williams blazes her own trail in the footsteps of history,\\u201d cnn: \\u201cwilliams is not only the first black woman to chair the georgia democratic party, she is also the first black woman to represent georgia\\u2019s 5th congressional district  the seat held by civil rights icon john lewis until his death last summer. \\u201clewis was williams\\u2019 mentor, friend and shopping buddy. She even met her husband, leslie small, who had worked for the civil right icon, thanks to lewis sending him on an errand to hillary clinton's georgia headquarters in 2008 where williams was working.

Dhs expects approximately 500,000 to 800,000 migrants to arrive as part of a family group during the 2021 fiscal year that ends in september, a quantity that would equal or exceed the record numbers who entered in 2019. \\u201d pandemic wapo: \\u201c\\u2018vaccine passports\\u2019 are on the way, but developing them won\\u2019t be easy\\u201d: \\u201cthe passports are expected to be free and available through applications for smartphones, which could display a scannable code similar to an airline boarding pass. Americans without smartphone access should be able to print out the passports, developers have said. \\u2026 \\u201cu. S. officials say they are grappling with an array of challenges, including data privacy and health-care equity. They want to make sure all americans will be able to get credentials that prove they have been vaccinated, but also want to set up systems that are not easily hacked or passports that cannot be counterfeited, given that forgeries are already starting to appear. \\u201d politics roundup considering all options  \\u201credistricting disarray nudges house democrats toward statewide bids,\\u201d by sarah ferris, ally mutnick and james arkin: \\u201cso far, a half-dozen democrats who could face some of the toughest redistricting prospects have floated bids for senate or governor  all in states where republicans have the ability to doom their house careers with new maps next year. \\u201cthis year\\u2019s once-a-decade redraw of congressional maps is made far more complicated by coronavirus-related delays in the process. And that uncertainty  on top of a 2022 election that could plunge democrats back into the minority  is leading some lawmakers to seriously consider political options beyond the house. \\u201d 2021 watch  \\u201cgop candidate from new jersey accused of pandering after he transforms into cowboy for texas run,\\u201d wapo: \\u201cin his first ad as a candidate for texas\\u2019s 6th congressional district, \\u2018big dan\\u2019 rodimer speaks in a gravelly, indistinct southern accent, throws jabs at democratic policies and compares house speaker nancy pelosi  to a bull.

What followed was a series of snarky and aggressive tweets that ended up fueling their own media cycles. \\u201cthe timing was likely not coincidental. Bezos and other amazon leaders are on edge as the company is facing the largest union election in its history at its bessemer, alabama warehouse. Election results will be tallied early this week, and amazon officials understand that if a majority of the employee voters vote to unionize, it could set off a chain reaction at other facilities, with the potential to force the e-commerce giant to overhaul how it manages its hundreds of thousands of front-line us workers. \\u201d dessert this one has nothing to do with politics, but it\\u2019s an incredible story: \\u201chis plane crashed in the amazon.
